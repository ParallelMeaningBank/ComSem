To submit a prediction file to the codalab competition,
you need to make a zip file where the prediction file is placed with the name 'pred':
You can use this command to do so:
$ cp trial.ans pred && zip -mvj any_name_you_want.zip pred

Note that it is important that the file is named 'pred' and it must NOT be in a directoy under the zip file.
